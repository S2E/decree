Cyber Grand Challenge
=====================

This repository contains artifacts used by S2E as part of Codejitsu's entry in DARPA's [Cyber Grand
Challenge](https://cybergrandchallenge.com).

Recipes
-------

Recipes tell S2E how to generate input so that the input can exploit the binary
[Type 1 and Type 2 vulnerabilities](https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/cgc-release-documentation/blob/master/walk-throughs/understanding-cfe-povs.md).
